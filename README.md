# MTG_APP

Project Description
The goal of this project was to practice building a full-stack application independently. The application tracks Magic: The Gathering games and provides meaningful statistics. The database was designed and implemented using MySQL on Docker. The backend was developed with Java, Spring Boot, and Maven within IntelliJ IDE, while the frontend was built with React.js, HTML, and CSS. Communication between the client and server was achieved through RESTful API calls. The project utilized test-driven development and includes a comprehensive suite of tests. Refer to the dev branch for reviewing code.
